### ToDo - future steps/ideas if time/ interest - or never...
* More refactoring
* Maybe Windows executable, maybe Java-interface
* Maybe GUI for interactive usage (ticker-selection)
* Experiment with broker API for automated trading
* Option for implementing indicators for use in technical analysis: RSI, MACD, Bollinger bands
* Add more advanced methods, e.g. maybe FFT, machine learning methods/principal component analysis/logistic regression/neural network, etc...
